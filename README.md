## Overview
We needed to update the city explorer app by using SQL in our backend API calls. We also needed to modularize our JS files.

## Getting Started
In order to build this app, the user must first fork and clone down our repo!

## Architecture
This project uses JavaScript, SQL, npm, Node.js, express, cors, dotenv, and postgres.

## Change Log
Welp. We totally forgot to fill this out as we went along.

On Wednesday, we scrapped together the movies API call, no problem. We got stumped on the Yelp API and almost figured that out as we left.

On Thursday, we were able to get the Yelp API working after a bit of time. Then we fixed up the weather and events calls so all 4 columns display properly.

With less than an hour to go, we had to try and figure out the modularizing of our js files. The demo code we were building off of was not functioning as expected so we went with a slightly different direction. We were able to separate our functions and get them to all centrally call from the server.js file.

On Friday, we remotely worked together to merge all changes. We ran into some merge conflicts but as of 5:34pm Friday, we have resolved all of those and are now doing final commits before we submit the lab. Everything works as expected on local. But I cannot figure out why our Heroku deployment is being wonky. May revisit with a TA on Saturday.
